I participated with my club team tjcsc in Haix-la-Chapelle 2025, and we got first place!

This challenge is a continuation of the challenge, "Tiny Blåhaj: lost and looking for help", and the files for both are the same. Above is the main file from the previous challenge.

So, in this challenge we need to find the bus line that the image was taken from as well as the final destination. 

The first thing I do with every file is run exiftool. Exiftool is a powerful CLI tool to extract metadata from files, especially for images, videos, and audio files:

Ahh, interesting! We have some useful data here. The date and time the picture was taken is October 24th, 2025 at 16:24. This is very important for finding the exact bus route!

The bus company is FlixBus. I have actually been on one of their busses before, but a simple reverse image search confirms this:

![](./1.png)

If we go to FlixBus's [website](https://global.flixbus.com/track?panelVisible=true), we can see a page dedicated for departures and arrivals at a specific location. Now, this begs a question. Is the bus arriving, or departing?

Going to the [Dortmund](https://global.flixbus.com/bus/dortmund) page, we can see the exact location of the bus station:

![](./2.png)

We can tell if the bus is departing or arriving based on the direction the bus is driving in the original picture. We can see that the bus is driving **toward** the book store, and using Google Maps:

![](./3.png)

We can tell that it is driving away from the bus station, meaning it must be departing.

I searched for departures from the Dortmund central bus station. Knowing that October 24th, 2025 was a Friday, I picked a Friday in the future to make sure that the bus route I was looking for would be active. Since I knew the picture was taken at 16:24 and that the location the picture was taken was not too far from the bus station, I knew the departure time was probably a few minutes before the picture was taken.

This is why I selected December 5th, 2025 (a Friday) as the date and 4:00 PM (16:00) as the time. Searching gave these results:

Great! I see one route that seems to fit. FlixBus N1360B departing at 16:20 headed to Medyka. Let's try that flag...

Perfect! `haix{n1360b_medyka}` worked and was the flag.

Thank you for reading my write-up! This was a great CTF, and I'd like to give a huge shoutout for the organizers for doing such a good job on organizing their first CTF!

If there's anything you think I could improve on in future write-ups, please let me know! 

Thank you and have a great day!
