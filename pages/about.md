## Hey! I'm Andrew (snowbird91)

I'm a high school junior intersted in cybersecurity and CTFs. I'm the captain of my school's computer security club and bounce between two teams:

- **[0xf1sh](https://0xf1.sh)** — main roster for CTFs: forensics, crypto, OSINT, and whatever gaps need filling.
- **[tjcsc](https://ctftime.org/team/53812)** — my high school club team.

### Focus areas
- Forensics, cryptography, OSINT
- Comfortable jumping into rev, pwn, web, and misc when needed

### What I'm up to
- Planning lectures and writing challenges for the club in-house CTF
- Learning how to write write-ups
- Deepening my knowledge of pwn, learning new techniques
- Making this website better :)
